It started with a dedication
Lost in admiration
"Happy birthday! I'm forever yours
Blossom". Faded red inside a tiny book of butterflies
I smiled surprised at how when flickered through
The wings flew by spelled out my name
Six months went by the summer lost
Obsessively the letters dropped into my life
The same soft blood smooth flowing hand
Please try to understand I have to see you have to feel you
Tell you all the ways I need you yours forever in love
